# tracker-nextjs
This example features how you use a different styling solution than styled-jsx that also supports universal styles. That means we can serve the required styles for the first render within the HTML and then load the rest in the client. In this case we are using styled-components.  For this purpose we are extending the &lt;Document /> and injecting the server side rendered styles into the &lt;head>, and also adding the babel-plugin-styled-components (which is required for server side rendering). Additionally we set up a global theme for styled-components using NextJS custom &lt;App> component.
